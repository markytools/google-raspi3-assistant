<p><u></u>For this project, we will be turning the Raspberry Pi into a Personal Assistant by integrating the Google Technology. The Assistant is going to have a variety of features such as answering general questions, turning the lights on/off, executing VoIP (Voice-over-Internet) calls, and playing music.</p>
<p>A personal assistant allows you to achieve specific tasks that you normally would want to be automated. An Intelligent Personal Assistant is &ldquo;a software that has been designed to assist people with basic tasks, usually providing information using natural language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, a personal voice assistant will be created by integrating the Google Assistant into the Raspberry Pi. The Assistant mainly uses a series of voice commands to activate its set of designated instructions.</p>
<p>The following are the features of what the Voice Assistant can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be able to introduce a speech recognition and speech synthetization software that will become the base feature of this project. The Raspberry Pi will use Google Assistant as its main online speech engine.</li>
<li>To be able to integrate CMU Sphinx, an open-source speech recognition system, and Pico TTS, the Google Android Text-to-Speech engine, with Google Assistant as its secondary alternative, i.e. for offline use.</li>
<li>To be able to use voice commands to turn the lights on and off.</li>
<li>To be able to use voice commands to request or answer phone calls over the internet.</li>
<li>To be able to use voice commands to play music</li>
</ul>
